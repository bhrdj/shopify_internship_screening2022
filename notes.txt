Dear Shopify manager,

I'm excited about drawing careful insights from big data, and helping small global businesses get big global sales is an exciting goal.

I've been practicing a full stack of development:
- getting data by webscraping or ETL with SQL
- data-cleaning and EDA with Python
- visualization with matplotlib or other diverse libraries
- data-modeling and data-pipelines for production
- delivering a front-end with html, css, and streamlit
- version control throughout with git/github
- working from local, server-hosted, and shared ipython notebooks

I also enjoy digging into math and I'm not scared to fill a page with algebra and calculus if it makes a process better, faster, or delivers insight.

Put me on one or any of any of these functions with any programming language or software, and I'll be a hard worker, humble learner, and team player.

I'm re-entering the workforce after a long hiatus as a full-time parent, so I have a lot of fresh focus and energy.

Warm Regards,
Steven Bhardwaj


I'd like to sell linux laptops. I can pick out machines whose hardware has well-supported drivers, and nowadays after that, everything just works. I'd like to see Linux get more consumer market share.
